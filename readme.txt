Page scroll to id is an easy-to-use jQuery plugin that enables animated page scrolling to specific id within the document.

== Description ==

The plugin replaces the default browser behaviour of "jumping" to page sections when links with href value containing `#` are clicked, by smoothly animating the page to those sections. You can use it for simple back-to-top links or complex, single-page website navigation and features include: 

* Auto-adjustable animation speed
* Advanced animation easings
* Vertical and/or horizontal scrolling
* Links and targets highlighting via ready-to-use classes
* Auto-adjustable scroll-to position 
* Advanced scroll-to position offset (by pixels, by element selector, link specific offsets etc.) 

= Demo =

* [Plugin demo: vertical layout](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo.html) 
* [Plugin demo: horizontal layout](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo-horizontal-layout.html) 
* [Plugin demo: auto layout](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo-auto-layout.html) 

= Requirements =

Page scroll to id requires WordPress version **3.3** or higher and jQuery version **1.6.0** or higher. For older installations implement it in your theme manually. 

= Quick usage =

1. [Install the plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/page-scroll-to-id/installation/). 
2. Add `rel="m_PageScroll2id"` to your links that point to existing sections within your page, making sure each link's href value contains a hash (`#`) with the id of the section you want to scroll-to. 

For more information see plugin resources below.

2. Perform a search for the term 'Page scroll to id' and in search results, click 'Install/Install Now' under plugin name. 
3. When installation is finished, click 'Activate Plugin'.

1. Download and extract the plugin. 
2. Upload the entire `page-scroll-to-id` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. 
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. 

= Configuration =

Configure plugin options by clicking 'Settings' or through the 'Settings > Page Scroll to id' menu in WordPress. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the plugin with WP custom/native menus? =

While on the 'Menus' admin page, click 'Screen Options' and check 'Link Relationship (XFN)'. To enable the plugin on a menu item, click the arrow on the right of the item and insert `m_PageScroll2id` in the 'Link Relationship (XFN)' field (assuming your menu contains links with `URL` value in the form of `#id`). 

= How to use the plugin without editing my theme's markup? =

In plugin's configuration page ('Settings > Page Scroll to id' menu in WordPress), you can change the `Selector(s)` field value to existing matching sets of elements in your theme. For example: `a.class-name`, `#id a`, `a[href*='#']` etc. For multiple selectors, use comma separated values: e.g. `a[rel='m_PageScroll2id'], a.class-name`.

= What if my links have rel values already set by the theme or other plugins? =

You can add the `m_PageScroll2id` in your link's rel attribute (along with the other values) and change the `Selector(s)` field value to `a[rel~='m_PageScroll2id']` in plugin settings. 

= How do I highlight current menu items? =

The plugin provides a ready-to-use class for styling highlighted links (the links whose target element is considered to be within the viewport). The default highlight class is `mPS2id-highlight`, so you can use it in your theme's CSS to style current menu items, e.g. `.menu-item a.mPS2id-highlight{ background: #ff0; }`. 

= When I click the link, nothing happens... =

Make sure your link has href value `#` with the id of the section you want to scroll-to (e.g. `<a href="#id" rel="m_PageScroll2id">link</a>`) and a section with such an id exists in your page (e.g. `<div id="id">target</div>`). 

= How do I make my links work from other/different pages =

To make your links work from any page, you need to add the full address in your links href (instead of just the hash with the id). For example, you'll need to change `<a href="#id" rel="m_PageScroll2id">link</a>` to something like `<a href="http://mysite.com/some-page/#id" rel="m_PageScroll2id">link</a>`. The same applies for your WP custom menus. You'll need to insert the full address in the `URL` field. 

= The page doesn't scroll exactly where I want =

The scroll-to position is the top position of your target element. Your target's top position does not include its margins, so make sure to check your element's actual position via your browser's developer tools and change your CSS if needed. You can also offset the scroll-to position by setting an `offset` value (in pixels) in plugin's settings. 

= The page doesn't scroll to the very top =

Your target element is probably not at the very top (check its position via your browser's developer tools). If your link has href value `#top` and no target with id `top` exists in your page, the plugin will automatically scroll the page to the very top (the position of the `body` tag). 

= How to prevent my fixed navigation menu overlapping the content? =

Insert your menu selector in the Offset field in plugin settings. For example, if you have a fixed menu with id `navigation-menu`, set Offset to `#navigation-menu` in order to stop page scrolling below it and avoid overlapping your content. 

= Can I specify link specific offset values? =

Yes, by adding the html attribute `data-ps2id-offset` to a link. For example, `<a href="#id" rel="m_PageScroll2id" data-ps2id-offset="100">link</a>` will offset scroll-to position by 100 pixels. You may also use the `ps2id` shortcode to create links with specific offsets, e.g. `[ps2id url='#id' offset='100']link[/ps2id]`. 

= Can I use the plugin to scroll an overflowed div? =

No. The plugin scrolls the entire page (the document's root element) so it works correctly highlighting links, alongside deep linking plugins etc. with mouse and touch events. 

= Do you support Internet Explorer 7? =

No. IE7 usage is non-existent. 

= Does the plugin offer user defined callbacks, scroll-to method or some other advanced feature? =

Yes but you probably need to implement the plugin in your theme **manually**. See [Plugin homepage](http://manos.malihu.gr/page-scroll-to-id/) for more info.
